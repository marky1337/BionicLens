Android App which runs inference on camera stream

## üì± Description
Mobile application which apply machine learning techniques using ML KIT APIs on Android. Each technique is presented as a single activity (All in one app).

Machine learning use-cases from the app:

- Object Recognition
- Face Detection
- Text Recognition and Translation
- Selfie segmentation
### üì∏ Camera
- [üì∑ CameraX example](app/src/main/java/com/asmaamir/mlkitdemo/CameraX): Preview, Capture and Analyze functionalities

## Functionality
- Real-time object detection, face detection, selfie segmentation and text recognition and translation
  - The application process frames in real time from camera stream
- Object detection
  - For each frame from live camera feed, the activity will start do detect and recognize different type of objects (up to 80 different type of objects) with a specific               confidence, multiple objects can be present in detection.
- Face detection
   - Real-time face detection, the activity will identify key facial features and contours of detected faces, 1 face contour at a time.
   - User has the option to customize the activity to focus on specific features to detect.
- Text Recognition and Translation
   - Real-time text recognition in any Latin-based languages, support for Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Devanagari (Hindi) symbols.
   - User has options for real-time translation to either Romanian or English
- Selfie segmentation
   - For each human detected, the activity will separate the background and focuses on human body.
   - User has the option to choose a virtual background from 3 static images found in the app.
- All results will displayed in a separate UI instance.
