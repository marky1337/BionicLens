![Android](https://img.shields.io/badge/platform-android-lightgrey.svg)

Android App which showcases multiple Machine Learning Computer Vision applications which can be performed by your mobile phone.

## üì± Description
Mobile application which runs different Machine Learning use-cases using Google ML KIT APIs on Android. Each use-case is presented as a single activity (All in one app).

Machine learning use-cases from the app:

- Object Recognition
- Face Detection
- Text Recognition and Translation
- Selfie Segmentation
### üì∏ Camera
- [üì∑ CameraX example](app/src/main/java/com/asmaamir/mlkitdemo/CameraX): Preview, Capture and Analyze functionalities

## Functionality
- Real-time object detection, face detection, selfie segmentation and text recognition and translation
  - The application process frames in real time from camera stream
- Object detection
  - For each frame from live camera feed, the activity will detect and recognize different types of objects (up to 631 different types of objects) with a specific               confidence, multiple objects can be present in detection.
  - User has the option to configure the object detection application.
- Face detection
   - Real-time face detection. The application will identify key facial features and contours of detected faces.
   - User has the option to customize the application to focus on specific features that should be detected.
- Text Recognition and Translation
   - Real-time text recognition of any languages with Latin-based, Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Devanagari (Hindi) symbols.
   - User has the option to turn ON real-time translation to either Romanian or English.
   - User will have to wait for the download of new Language Translation Models before they are used for the first time.
- Selfie Segmentation
   - For each person detected, the activity will separate the background and will focus on the person's body.
   - User has the option to choose a virtual background from 3 static images found in the app.
- All results will be displayed in a separate UI instance.
